To get this working, first we recommend for you to create virtual environtment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

After this activate it.
Unix:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Windows:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then you have to install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
